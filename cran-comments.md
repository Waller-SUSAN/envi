## This is the eighth resubmission

* Updates since previous submission:
  * Replaced `parallel` and `doParallel` packages in Imports with `doFuture`, `doRNG`, and `future` packages to allow for parallel processing in `lrren()` and `perlrren()` functions to work across all CRAN environments
  * Removed `utils` package from Imports because the progress bar in `lrren()` and `perlrren()` functions is now produced with a helper function in utils.R that imports the `iterators` package
  * Set default for `n_core` argument in `lrren()` and `perlrren()` to be `n_core = 2` to match documentation
    * Fixed bug in `pval_correct()` when `p_correct = "FDR"` that will return the minimum p-value instead of NULL if no p-value is less than the p-critical value
  * Updated testthat checks for parallelization in `lrren()` and `perlrren()` functions

## Test environments
